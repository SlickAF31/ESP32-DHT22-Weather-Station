ESP32 DHT22 Weather Station
This project demonstrates how to use an ESP32 to create a simple weather station that measures temperature and humidity using a DHT22 sensor. The data is served via a web server hosted on the ESP32, displaying the current temperature and humidity readings.

Features
Connects to a WiFi network
Reads temperature and humidity from a DHT22 sensor
Serves a web page with real-time temperature and humidity updates
Requirements
ESP32 development board
DHT22 sensor
Arduino IDE with ESP32 and necessary libraries installed
Installation
Clone this repository.
Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
Update the WiFi SSID and password in the code.
Upload the code to the ESP32.
