# ESP32 DHT22 Weather Station

This project demonstrates how to use an ESP32 to create a simple weather station that measures temperature and humidity using a DHT22 sensor. The data is served via a web server hosted on the ESP32, displaying the current temperature and humidity readings.

## Features
- Connects to a WiFi network
- Reads temperature and humidity from a DHT22 sensor
- Serves a web page with real-time temperature and humidity updates

## Requirements
- ESP32 development board
- DHT22 sensor
- Arduino IDE with ESP32 and necessary libraries installed

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
3. Update the WiFi SSID and password in the code.
4. Upload the code to the ESP32.
